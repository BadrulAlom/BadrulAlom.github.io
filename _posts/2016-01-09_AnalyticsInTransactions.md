Analytics in transactions is about about trying to provide buyers and sellers with a more robust assessment of a business they are considering buying or selling. This means having analysis that is robust, timely, comparable, and, ideally, quantifable in terms of valuation price.

Currently financial due diligence is performed to gain a better grasp of what the true EBITDA of a company looks like, and miscellaneous analysis around revenue or potential synergies is carried out on a case by case basis. The problem with this is the high amount of manpopwer that is required as well as the the fact that every case is looked at in isolation. It can identify red flags but can it tell me if the growth rate I'm seeing for a particular product line is ok, good or very good? And can I determine this in a systematic yet timely manner?

Enter analytics. Analytics can help answer these questions in several ways:

1. Data Visualiztion for more intuitive understanding

A first step in the use of analytics within M&A is to simply enable decion-makers to get a better feel for the acquisition target through the use of data visualization.

2. Automatic data analysis

By standardizing the analysis, say for instance the ability to take a sales ledger as raw data input, and to then automatically output answers to questions  such as 'Was the revenue increase for product X consistent across sales regions?'. Better yet, an intelligent system would analyze the data for you across many different dimnensions and push up to the top the most interesting patterns for your consideration

3. Benchmarking & Data-munging:

Having external datasets on any industry or domain is a great complement to the internal datasets obtained from the target by request. DIfferent inudstries will have different data sets available; either freely avaiable on line, through subscribing to an external database, or from collating metrics from previous transactions. Having this data stored in a way that allows for rapid use on transations and integration with a wider analytical toolkit allows benchmarking and a better understanding of "how good is good?".
The most obvious measure to track would be the valuation multiple. For comapnies in cyclical industries the EV-to-EBITDA multiple is a good valauation metric, and building up a data points of this within an industry would be very useful. Another example would be to track the operating structure of many organizations in order to help determine what the new operating structure for a target ought to be.

4. Predictive modeling

Applying statistical modeling techniques such as time-series forecasting, cluster ananlysis, and linear regression, can lead to better revenue forecasts, and understanding of growth drivers than may be obtained through maangements own reports. Again the key is to be able to do this in a timely fashion rather than the high cost of bespoke modeling that currently exists

Ultimately one should not lose sight of the fact that the analytics only matters if it's adding value to the decision maker, and in this context this means - does it affect the transaction price and if so by how much? Translating findings into cold hard $ terms is tough to do, partly due to the subjective nature of how much value to place on different findings. However by having a valuation framework & scenario analysis tool set up that allows one to combine traditional cashflow based valuation with additional insight obtained through analytics, will help decision makers from inferring their own valuation. So for example if through anaysis I show that one particular product line was largely responsible for the growth, and I had the ability to see the impact on my valuation of projecting a different growth curve for that product line, then I could get a feel for how much I should value the target under a different future outlook.
