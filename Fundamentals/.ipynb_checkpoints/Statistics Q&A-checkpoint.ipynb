    "The Poisson distribution is popular for modeling the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution applies when: \n",
    "<br>(1) the event is something that can be counted in whole numbers; \n",
    "<br>(2) occurrences are independent, so that one occurrence neither diminishes nor increases the chance of another; <br>(3) the average frequency of occurrence for the time period in question is known; and \n",
    "<br>(4) it is possible to count how many events have occurred, such as the number of times a firefly lights up in my garden in a given 5 seconds, some evening, but meaningless to ask how many such events have not occurred. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This last point sums up the contrast with the Binomial situation, where the probability of each of two mutually exclusive events (p and q) is known. The Poisson Distribution, so to speak, is the Binomial Distribution Without Q (the probability of not a success). In those circumstances, and they are surprisingly common, the Poisson Distribution gives the expected frequency profile for events. It may be used in reverse, to test whether a given data set was generated by a random process. If the data fit the Poisson Expectation closely, then there is no strong reason to believe that something other than random occurrence is at work. On the other hand, if the data are lumpy, we look for what might be causing the lump.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The Poisson situation is most often invoked for rare events, and it is only with rare events that it can successfully mimic the Binomial Distribution (for larger values of p, the Normal Distribution gives a better approximation to the Binomial). But the Poisson rate may actually be any number. The real contrast is that the Poisson Distribution is asymmetrical: given a rate $\\lambda$ = 3, the range of variation ends with zero on one side (you will never find \"minus one\" letter in your mailbox), but is unlimited on the other side (if the label machine gets stuck, you may find yourself some Tuesday with 4,573 copies of some magazine spilling all over your front yard - it's not likely, but you can't call it impossible). The Poisson Distribution, as a data set or as the corresponding curve, is always skewed toward the right, but it is inhibited by the Zero occurrence barrier on the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of skew diminishes as r becomes larger, and at some point the Poisson Distribution becomes, to the eye, about as symmetrical as the Normal Distribution. But much though it may come to resemble the Normal Distribution, to the eye of the person who is looking at a graph for, say, $\\lambda$ = 35, the Poisson is really coming from a different kind of world event. \n",

Accordingly, if a 95% confidence interval is calculated from the results of the second sample, it probably will differ from the interval just found. Imagine taking a very large number of independent random samples of 64 observations from this population and, from each sample result, calculating a 95% confidence interval. The confidence level of the interval implies that in the long run, 95% of intervals found in this manner contain the true value of the population mean.
