Welcome to my Github landing page. Here you'll find links to my personal projects, my notes on data science & machine learning, and articles I've written.

## Projects & Tutorials
#### [Consumer: Forecasting Web Traffic Time-series data)(https://github.com/BadrulAlom/Web-Traffic-Time-Series-Prediction)
Kaggle comptition currently going on. Will update once initial deadline has passed.

#### [Consumer: Modeling temporal patterns of music listeners](https://github.com/BadrulAlom/EventPrediction)

MSc dissertation project in which transform music listening data into time-series data and attempt to predict play events based on past occurrences.

Keywords: SQLite3, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow (RNN-LSTM model)


#### [Bio: Protein Function Prediction using deep learning](https://github.com/BadrulAlom/Protein-Function-CNN-Model)
Here I try to predict the sub-cellular locaion of proteins based on their genomic sequence. Tried out an innovative idea of using Convolutional Neural nets. 

Keywords: Keras, Convolutional Neural Nets


#### [NLP: Sentence order prediction](https://github.com/BadrulAlom/Sentence-Order-Prediction)
Group MSc project in which we try to order sentences using an LSTM model with word embeddings.

Keywords: Tensorflow, LSTM, Word embedding
