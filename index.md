Welcome to my Github landing page. Here you'll find links to my personal projects, my notes on data science & machine learning, and articles I've written. The site was started in August 2017 and is being continually updated and improved. 

## New projects & tutorials

[Crypto Data Science - new repo to store experiments](https://github.com/ReddSpark1/cryptods)

[My Plutus repo (New Github Repo started July 2021 for Plutus Pioneer)](https://github.com/ReddSpark1/myplutus)

[Setting up Keras and Tensorflow in Anaconda (external link)]
(https://oindrilasen.com/2021/02/how-to-install-and-import-keras-in-anaconda-jupyter-notebooks/)

## Old projects & tutorials

#### [Consumer: Modeling temporal patterns of music listeners](https://github.com/Reddspark1/EventPrediction)

Academic Dissertation project in which I transform music listening data into time-series data and attempt to predict play events based on past occurrences.

*Uses: SQLite3, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow (RNN-LSTM model)*


#### [Bio: Protein Function Prediction using deep learning](https://github.com/ReddSpark1/Protein-Function-CNN-Model)
Here I try to predict the sub-cellular location of proteins based on their genomic sequence. Tried out an innovative idea of using Convolutional Neural nets. 
*Uses: Keras, Convolutional Neural Nets*

#### [NLP: Sentence order prediction](https://github.com/ReddSpark1/Sentence-Order-Prediction)
Group project in which we try to order sentences using an LSTM model with word embeddings.

*Uses: Tensorflow, LSTM, Word embedding*

## My tutorials
Had to piece these together myself, surprisingly hard to find good clear step by step tutorials on Spark.
