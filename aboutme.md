## About Me

I've worn many hats during my career - computer programmer, database developer, operational researcher, government statistician, financial modeller.

I'm originally from the UK, where I first studied a BSc in computing, built a reinforcement learning algorithm to play the Snake game, then worked as a programmer, decided programmers don't get enough respect, decided to study an MSc in Operational Research, worked as a business modeling/analytics consultant for the Big 4, took a short break to go word in stats and OR for the UK Dept. of Education (really enjoyable job), came back to the Big 4, this time in NYC, built solutions in Excel/SQL Server/Powerpivot/PowerBI/Spotfire, saw that machine learning was back in vogue, decided to go do an MSc in Machine Learning and Data Science to refresh my knoweldge, and now back again at the Big 4 pushing analytics/ data science / machine learning across what we do. 

Interested in all things that fall under the umbrella of data science and machine learning!
