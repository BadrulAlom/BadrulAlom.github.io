<p><br />
This page contains some key statistics knowledge. Everything is written in Q&amp;A format. Best way to use this page is what I call “Iterateive Failure”: Start at the top, and work down, every single time you get a question wrong, go back to the top and start again. Keep doing that, over and over again until you can go through the entire page without getting anything wrong. Or if you get bored or that way, start from the bottom an work your way up. Aim to get the all of the steps of the solution right.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. If you spot any mistakes let me know.</p>

<h2> Probability Fundamentals</h2>

<p><b> How do you calculate the total probability of lots of multiple things that happen in order and can affect the chance of the next thing?</b>
<br /><br />
Bayes Theorem &amp; Chain Rule. If a,b and c happen, in that order, then total prob = <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
p(a) * p(b|a) * p(c|a \& b) %]]></script></p>

<p><b>What is the probability of anything happening ‘at least once’?</b></p>

<p>1 - P(never happening)</p>

<p><b>What is the probability of anything happening ‘at least X times’?</b></p>

<p>Assuming the ‘thing’ in question either happens or does not happen each time, then this can be answered using the binomial probability formula.</p>

<p><b>Two fair dice are thrown. Let X be the smallest of the two numbers obtained
(or the common value if the same number is obtained on both dice). Find the
probability mass function (i.e. the distribution) of X. Find <script type="math/tex">P(X > 3)</script>.</b>
<br />
<code>
Ans:
6x6 = 36 possibilities in total
Any two numbers has a 1 /36 chance
p(X&gt;3) = p(4,4)+p(4,5)*2+p(5,5)+p(6,4)*2+p(6,5)*2+p(6,6) = 0.25 =&gt; 25%</code></p>

<p><b>On a coral reef, S species of fish are present in proportions <script type="math/tex">p1, ... , pS</script>. A
biologist wishes to take a sample of the fish, and wants to know how many
species of fish she should expect to find in a sample of a given size.<br />
<br />(a) Suppose a sample of size <script type="math/tex">n</script> is taken. Let <script type="math/tex">X_i (i = 1, ... ,S)</script> be a random variable taking the value 1 if species i occurs, 0 otherwise. Find an expression for <script type="math/tex">E(X_i)</script>. </b>
<br />(Assume that, first, the sample is small relative to the population
of any fish species, so that taking the sample has a negligible effect on the
proportions of fish remaining; second, species are distributed randomly so
that successive fish in the sample can be regarded as independent draws
from the population).
<br /><br />
<b>(b) Now let Y be the number of fish species present in the sample. Express Y
in terms of the <script type="math/tex">X_i</script>’s, and deduce that the expected number of species is
<script type="math/tex">S-\sum_{i=1}^{S}(1-p_i)^n</script>
Are you making any further assumptions in obtaining this result? Check
that the formula gives the correct result for a couple of different sample
sizes where the answer is “obvious”.</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Answer:</b><br />
S = # of different fish species<br />
<script type="math/tex">p_i</script> = proportion of fish i = probability of fish i<br />
<script type="math/tex">X_i</script> = {1,0}= fish i occurs, not occurs<br /> 
<script type="math/tex">E(X_i</script>) = average value for <script type="math/tex">X_i</script><br />
n = sample size<br />
<br />
a) 
There are lots of different ways that we can say the sample ‘contained at least 1 fish of type i’, and we cannot just do <script type="math/tex">(P_i)^n</script> as this is the probability of <i>every</i> fish in the sample being fish <script type="math/tex">i</script>.
However there is only 1 way it could be 0 (the probability that every fish in the sample does not equal that fish). <br />
P(not getting fish i in 1 fish) = <script type="math/tex">1-p_i</script><br />
multiplied by total fish sampled = <script type="math/tex">1-(1-p_i)^n = E[X_i]</script>
<br /><i>Note: If we were using “weight of fish” rather than a simple binary measure then we’d want to multiply the prob. by the weight to get to the E(weight). </i>
<br /><br />
b) Y = <script type="math/tex">\sum E[X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^S 1-(1-p_i)^n = S - \sum_{i=1}^S (1-p_i)^n</script>
<br />(If you are not following the last step - just think of the middle terms as being the sum of 1’s minus the sum of the probs).<br />
<br />Assume uniform distribution of fish in population and S = 10 species. Check result when n= 1 where Y should = 1, and 10000 where Y = S.</p>

<h2> Probability Distributions</h2>

<p><b>Describe the Bernoulli,  Binomal distributions and the Possion Distributions</b>
<p><br />
A <b>Bernoulli</b> distribution is when the outcome of an event is binary - success or not.
<br />
A <b>Binomial</b> is like a Benoulli but repeated multiple times (e.g. flipping a coin 10 times). It requires knowing the prob. of something occurring (&amp; hence not occuring too)
<br />
P(k num of successes out of n trials) = $$\binom{n}{k}* p(Success)^k*P(Not Success)^{n-k} =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} * p^kq^{n-k}$$

n = number of trials<br />
k = number of successes
nCr on calculator will perform the $$\binom{n}{k}$$ section
</p>
<br />
The <b>Poisson</b> distribution is popular for modeling the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time or space.
<br />
$$P\left( X \ events \ in \ interval\right) = \frac{{\lambda ^x e^{ - \lambda } }}{{x!}}$$
<br />
<br />e: A constant equal to approximately 2.71828. (Actually, e is the base of the natural logarithm system.)
<br />$$\lambda$$: (sometimes referred to as mean $$\mu$$). The mean number of successes that occur in a specified period.
<br />x: The actual number of successes that occur in a specified period.
<br />P(x; $$\lambda$$): The Poisson probability that exactly x successes occur in a Poisson experiment, when the mean number of successes is $$\lambda$$. 
<br /><br />
It applies when: 
<br />(1) occurrences are independent, so that one occurrence neither diminishes nor increases the chance of another; <br />(2) the average frequency of occurrence for the time period in question is known; and 
<br />(3) it is possible to count how many events have occurred, such as the number of times a firefly lights up in my garden in a given 5 seconds, some evening, but meaningless to ask how many such events have not occurred. 
<br />
<br />
The Poisson Distribution is asymmetrical: given a rate $$\lambda$$ = 3, the range of variation ends with zero on one side (you will never find "minus one" letter in your mailbox), but is unlimited on the other side (if the label machine gets stuck, you may find yourself some Tuesday with 4,573 copies of some magazine spilling all over your front yard - it's not likely, but you can't call it impossible). The Poisson Distribution, as a data set or as the corresponding curve, is always skewed toward the right, but it is inhibited by the Zero occurrence barrier on the left. 

The degree of skew diminishes as r becomes larger, and at some point the Poisson Distribution becomes, to the eye, about as symmetrical as the Normal Distribution. But much though it may come to resemble the Normal Distribution, to the eye of the person who is looking at a graph for, say, $$\lambda$$ = 35, the Poisson is really coming from a different kind of world event. 

<br />
<br />The cumulative version of this formula is simply to calculate it individually and add it up, or use a Poisson table.

<p><b>For each case below, state whether the binomial distribution is suitable. If not,
give your reasons; if it would, state the values of parameters trials, n and probability p.<br />

<br />(ii) The number of girls in the families of British prime ministers.
<br />(iii) The number of aces in a hand of four cards dealt from a standard pack of
cards.
<br />(iv) The number of students in a class of 40 whose birthday falls on a Sunday
this year.
<br />(v) The number of throws of a fair coin until the first head is obtained.</b>
<br />
<br />
Binomial Distribution require number of trials n, and probabilty of success p, to remain fixed
<br />1)Yes, n=3, p=1/6
<br />2)No - n is not a constant (different families have different numbers of children)
<br />3)No, prob of Aces is not constant (decreases over time)

<br />
i) <br />
p(k&gt;=8) = p(k=8)+p(k=9)+p(k=10)
<br />Using Binomal theorem where n=10, p=0.25:<br />
p(k=8) = <script type="math/tex">\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} * 0.25^8 * 0.75^{2} = 0.0038 *</script><br />
p(k=9) = <script type="math/tex">\frac{10!}{9!(10-9)!} * 0.25^9 * 0.75^{1}</script> = 0.00028<br />
p(k=10) = <script type="math/tex">\frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} * 0.25^{10} * 0.75^{0} = 0.00007</script>
<br />= 0.004
<br />In R:
dbinom(10, size=10, prob=0.25)+dbinom(9, size=10, prob=0.25)+dbinom(8, size=10, prob=0.25) = 0.0004</p>

ii) We know the answer to p(of getting at least 8) from part I. So this becomes a new binomial question with k = 1, n=6, and p=0.0004.</p>

<p>&lt;/b&gt;
<br />
Assuming the past 100 days is typical and component failures are independent of one another then we can computer the probability of failure usisng the Poisson distribution:<br />

<p><b>A typist makes on average 2 mistakes per page. What is the probability of a particular page having no errors on it? </b>
<br /><br />
We have an average rate here: <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> = 2 errors per page.
Using Poisson distribution. 
(<script type="math/tex">\lambda</script>) = (2 errors per page * 1 page) = 2.
Hence P0 = <script type="math/tex">\frac{2^0}{0!} * exp(-2) = 0.135</script>.</p>

<p><b>Components are packed in boxes of 20. The probability of a component being defective is 0.1. What is the probability of a box containing 2 defective components? </b></p>

<p>p(defective) = 0.1 and hence p(not defective) = 0.9. Hence, Binomial, with n = 20.</p>

<p>P(2 detective out of 20 trials) = <script type="math/tex">=  \frac{20!}{2!(18)!} * 0.1^20.9^{18} = 190 * 0.002 = 0.285</script></p>

<p><b>A coin is tossed 10 times. What is the probability that exactly 6 heads will occur.</b></p>

<p><code>Using Binomial formula:
Success = "A head is flipped on a single coin"
p = 0.5
q = 0.5
n = 10
x = 6
P(x=6) = 10C6 * 0.5^6 * 0.5^4 = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625 = 0.205078125 </code></p>

<p><b>Say you toss 1,000 different coins once each, which you assume are identically
distributed. Would you change your test for fairness? Would you think of ways in
which the test could fail to behave as expected?</b></p>

<p>Assuming coins were independent (iid) the binomial could be used.
If not independent (e.g. coins always landed tails if the year they were made was an odd number, and head otherwise) then you could end up with it not rejecting the null hypothesis when it ought to be rejected</p>

<p><b>If you toss a coin 1,000 times and observe 570 heads, how would you assess the claim
that the coin is fair?</b>
<br />
<script type="math/tex">H_0 = p(H) = 0.5</script><br />
Using Binomial: n = 1000, k = 570 
<script type="math/tex">\frac{1000!}{570!(1000-570)!} * 500^k500^{1000-570}</script>
<br />This does not work on a calculator so use R instead:
In R:   <code>binom.test(500,1000,0.5) </code>
<code>
Output:
Data:  500 and 1000
number of successes = 500, number of trials = 1000, p-value = 1
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.4685492 0.5314508
sample estimates:

<h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>

<p><img src="img/CI.png" /></p>

<p><b>What is a sampling distribution?</b></p>

<p>It’s the distribution of a statistic that you get from taking lots of samples from a population. So you take a sample, work out your statistic (e.g. mean of your sample), throw the sample away, and repeat. Over-time you will build up a picture (i.e. distribution) of your statistic. The <b>mean</b> of that statistic, whether it’s the mean of a mean or mean of something else, will get closer to the mean of the populaton statistic, with the more samples you have and the greater the sample size is.</p>

<p><img src="img/samplingdist.png" height="200" width="400" /></p>

<p><b> How can you compare the mean across two populations?</b><br />
If you have two samples (a &amp; b) which you believe ought to have the same underlying distribution and which to do a test to see if this is the case then:<br />
a) You will want to test the difference in a test statistic (e.g. the mean) between a &amp; b
<br />b) Provided the samples are both large enough OR both samples are assumed to be from a normal distribution, then you will be able to assume that the difference you see between a and b would follow a normal distribution.
<br />c) You can therefore test this difference by saying your null hypothesis is the difference is not statististically different from a difference of 0.
<br />d) To work out the boundary (i.e. Confidence Interval) where you can say this you would compute:</p>

<p>If you took just one sample from the population, you could either ask yourself how close are you to the true statistic, and if you think you are far, then continue sampling; or you could ask whether you are</p>

<p><b>You want to  conduct a survey in which you know the population mean to be 0 and need to determine the right sample size for your survey.

<br /><br />
a) 
To calculate a confidence interval you need:
<script type="math/tex">\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</script>
<script type="math/tex">\sigma = std. dev</script>
<br />b) We want the test to be at the 95% Confidence Level. For a two tailed test at this level we know that Z=+/- 1.96 for an alpha of 0.05 (95% confidence) spread out across two tails 
<br /><br />
c) Therefore we can say our critical region (a fancy word for the remaining 5% not in the confidence interval) would be from <script type="math/tex">CriticalRegion = \bar{X} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sqrt\sigma}{\sqrt{10}}</script></p>

<code>The sample variance is a function of the data, defined as the sample average of (x_i – x_bar)^2, that is, sum_i{(x_i – x_bar)^2} / n. It also  gives an estimate of the variance of the data distribution. When n goes to infinite, the sample variance goes to s^2 (in most reasonable conditions).</code></p>

<p>s^2 / n is <em>not</em> the sample variance. It is the variance X_bar, which has its own distribution that is related to but <em>not</em> the same as the distribution of  X_1 or X_2 etc.. Consider the following. Remember from exercise sheet 1 that Var(aX + b) = a^2 * Var(X), for constants a and b. Also, Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) if X and Y are independent.</p>

<p>The following then shows how Var(X_bar) is derived from Var(X_1) = Var(X_2) = … = Var(X_n) = s^2:
1.       Var(X_bar) =  Var((X_ 1 + .. + X_n) /  n  = Var((X_1 + … + X_n)) / n^2 =
2.       (Var(X_1) + … + Var(X_n)) / n^2 =
3.       n * s^2  / n^2 =
4.       s^2 / n.
We can estimate s^2 / n by “sample variance” / n.</p>

<p>Which is not the same as the variance of some other given statistic. For instance, if I take the sample median (sort the data ; pick point in the middle), its variance in general is <em>not</em> sigma^2 /n (it will be if the sample median and the sample mean are the same, but in general they are not) so “sample variance” / n might not make sense as an estimate of the variance of the sample median (hence, the bootstrap can help here). If I take the sample maximum (like in question 10 of exercise 3), its variance in general is not sigma^2  /n either.</p>

<p>That is, Var(X_1) = … = Var(X_n) = s^2, which is different from Var(Sample average) which may be different from Var(Sample median) which may be different from Var(Sample Maximum) etc.&lt;/code&gt;</p>

  <li>Confidence Intervals can be constructed for any sample statistic, not just the mean</li>
  <li>Confidence interval = sample statistic <script type="math/tex">\pm</script> Margin of error</li>
  <li>Margin of error (ME) = Critical value * (either Standard deviation OR Standard error of sample statistic)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Finding the critical value</b><br />
The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of a statistic will be nearly normal, if the sample size is large enough. As a rough guide, many statisticians say that a sample size of 30 is large enough when the population distribution is bell-shaped. But if the original population is badly skewed, has multiple peaks, and/or has outliers, researchers like the sample size to be even larger.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain your alpha <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script>, which is (1 - confidence level)</li>
  <li>Divide alpha by 2 if doing a two-tail test and then use either the Z-table or the T-Table to get a Z or T score:
    <ul>
      <li>If the population standard deviation is known, use the z-score.</li>
      <li>If the population standard deviation is unknown, use the t statistic.</li>
      <li>Another approach focuses on sample size.</li>
      <li>If the sample size is large, use the z-score. (The central limit theorem provides a useful basis for determining whether a sample is “large”.)</li>
      <li>If the sample size is small, use the t statistic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>George Samson is responsible for quality assurance at Integrated Electronics. Integrated Electronics has just signed a contract with a company in China to manufacture a control device that is a component of its manufacturing robotics products. Integrated Electronics wants to be sure that these new, lower-cost components meet its high-quality standards. George has asked you to establish a quality-monitoring process for checking shipments of control device A. The variability of the electrical resistance, measured in ohms, is critical for this device. Manufacturing standards specify a standard deviation of 3.6, and the population distribution of resistance measurements is normal when the components meet the quality specification. The monitoring process requires that a random sample of n = 6 observations be obtained from each shipment of devices and the sample variance be computed. Determine an upper limit for the sample variance such that the probability of exceeding this limit, given a population standard deviation of 3.6, is less than 0.05.

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>

<p><b>Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in the table below correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.<br /></b>
<img src="img/Q4_1.png" height="300" width="500" /></p>

<p>Null hypothesis <script type="math/tex">H_0</script>: No linear relationship between the number of units sold and intercept, TV, radio, or newspaper.
So for Intercept, TV, and radio, the small p-value means that there is evidence that
these contributed to the behaviour of sales, while newpaper advertising did not
(given advertising in other media). It cannot be concluded that spending money
on newspaper advertising is useless, only that it seems not to contribute to sales
when TV and radio are being used. It also does not mean that changing the way
newspaper funds are used would continue not to show an effect on sales, only that
the way done in the data does not seem to work.</p>

<p><b>What is the power of a test</b>
<br />
power = 1 – β.
In plain English, statistical power is the likelihood that a study will detect an effect when there is an effect there to be detected. If statistical power is high, the probability of making a Type II error, or concluding there is no effect when, in fact, there is one, goes down.</p>

<p><b>What are the names for the inputs and outputs of a lineear regression model?</b>
<br /><br />
Input variables can be called:
    - Covariates
    - Inputs
    - Regressors
    - Independent variables (bad name!)
<br />Output variable is called:
    - Output
    - Response
    - Dependent variable (bad name!)</p>

<hr />

<p><b> What is Heteroscedasticity</b>
<br /><br />
In linear regression this means that your variance / error is not consistent due to sub-groups within your data. Example plotting the residuals may show variance increasing over time.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>What is collinearity?</b>
<br /><br />
When two or more variables are closely correlated with one another</p>

<p><b>If your Linear regression model seemed to indicate “If we increase the TV budget by one thousand then, other things being equal, I will sell 400 hundred more units of my product, in expectation.” would this imply it was true?</b>
<br /><br />
No - because there might be hidden causes that is causing both to happen. Example the data from the larger advertising budget came from more economically affluent areas where shoppers have more money to spend</p>

<h2><b>Questions that are yet to be answered...</b></h2>

<p><b>One method we have seen for finding confidence intervals is finding pivots such as
    <script type="math/tex">Q(X, \mu) \equiv \frac{(\hat{\mu}(X) - \mu)}{\hat{\sigma}(X)}</script>, where we explicitly represented empirical average <script type="math/tex">\hat{\mu}</script>
and empirical standard deviation <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> as functions of the data X. A pivot is not a
statistic as it depends on the unknown parameter, but it has a distribution which
does not (N(0, 1) in a typical example).<br />
<br />Another way of building a confidence interval is by inverting a test statistic.
For instance, suppose we have data <script type="math/tex">X^{(1)}...X^{(n)} ~ N(\mu, \sigma^2)</script> from a known <script type="math/tex">\sigma^2</script> but
unknown <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>. Consider some test for H0 : <script type="math/tex">\mu</script> = <script type="math/tex">\mu_0</script> at a level <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script>. Describe how the
machinery behind this test can be converted into a 1 - <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> confidence interval for <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>.</b></p>

<p>First of all let’s translate this to plain English.
<br />Pivot - refers to anything around which we can build a confidence interval. It’s true value will be unknown but it will have a probability distribution, typically a Gaussian one.</p>

i) We have a probability here, so we know a bimial probability distribution can be used.

J ~ Binomial(586,<script type="math/tex">p_2</script>)
