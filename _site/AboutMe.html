<p>My name is Badrul Alom. I’m from the UK and interested in all things that fall under the analytics/data science umbrella.</p>

<p>I’ve worn many hats during my career - computer programmer, database developer, operational researcher, government statistician, financial modeller. Right now I’m enrolled on an MSc. in Data Science at UCL and will soon add machine learning to my area of specialism (something that I was quite interested during my undergradute days when programming and machine learning were not as cool as they are now).</p>
