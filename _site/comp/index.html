<p>Computing for Data Science covers a wide range of areas.</p>

<h3 id="programming">Programming</h3>
<p>Python, R, and Java are three widely used programming languages in data science.
R is widely used for statistical analysis (increasingly overtaking SAS)
Python is widely used as a general purpose programming language plus machine learning (increasingly overtaking Matlab)
Java is widely used as a heavy duty programming language and is particularly useful for cloud andd big data applications</p>

<p>Furthermore there are upcoming languages like Scala (also useful for big data) and Julia (supposedly combines the benefits of R, Python and Java) that is worth being somewhat aware of.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-computing">Cloud computing</h3>
<p>Cloud computing is becoming increasinly popular. It’s the idea of moving from having IT systmes maintained in-house by ones own IT department, to having it managed by external providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, and interacting with it through the web on a pay as you go basis. The ability to do this opens up new business models such as:
- Infrastructure As A Service - whereby computer hardware is available on demand and you can choose what you do with it
- Platform As A Service - whereby computer hardware + operating system are available on demand and you can choose what you do with it
- Software As A Service - where by hardware + Operating system + user software is available on demand and you can just interact with it without needing it install anything</p>

<p>In the cloud computing space the three main providers are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/">Google Cloud Compute</a>, with the first two currently being the dominant players.</p>

<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>For years relational SQL databases were the dominant force in the database space with Oracle and SQL Server being two of the most established enterprise products.
However in recent years NOSQL (Not-Only-SQL) databases have taken a hold as being better suited for storing unstructured data.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>A lot of data science is done on the Linux platform. I will say I’m not a fan of Linux however it has increasingly become my main operating system.</p>
