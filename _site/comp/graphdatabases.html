<p>“Initially, you classify the raw documents by types and subtypes (like contract or invitation). Then you attach as much direct and indirect metadata as you can, either directly from the document types (like the senders and receivers of an email or parties of a contract). Inferred metadata is gained from the content of the documents. There are techniques like natural language processing, named entity recognition or plain text search for well-known terms like distinctive names or roles.</p>

<p>Some relationships can be directly inferred from the documents. Other relationships can be inferred by analyzing email records. If we see several emails between a person and a company we can infer that the person is a client of that company. We can use similar logic to create relationships between entities that share the same address, have family ties or business relationships or that regularly communicate.”</p>
