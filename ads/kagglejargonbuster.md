## Cutting through Kaggle Jargon

Spend more than a minute on the Kaggle site and beginners will find themselves baffled by some jargon that is known only to experienced Kagglers. This page aims to de-mystify that.
I shall document such jargon as I encounter them.

MLP: Multi-layer perceptron
[Siamese Networks](https://www.quora.com/What-are-Siamese-neural-networks-what-applications-are-they-good-for-and-why):Siamese neural network is a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical subnetworks. identical here means they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights. Parameter updating is mirrored across both subnetworks.

Siamese NNs are popular among tasks that involve finding similarity or a relationship between two comparable things.
